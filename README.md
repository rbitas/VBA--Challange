# VBA--Challange
Instructions

Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:
  The ticker symbol
  Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  The total stock volume of the stock. The result should match the following image:<img width="1301" alt="2018 results" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/124088429/222967219-2be3f0a2-bf1c-46b8-8158-90ae6d6a28df.png">


Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". The solution should match the following image:<img width="1038" alt="hard_solution" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/124088429/222967258-6c69e0a7-04a2-499e-a90e-cd885f1c8b75.png">

Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.
